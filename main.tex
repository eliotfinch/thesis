The study of black-hole ringdown, the endpoint of a binary black-hole merger, is a cornerstone of gravitational-wave astronomy. 
A black hole's characteristic quasinormal-mode spectrum offers the possibility of clean and powerful tests of general relativity, encoding the properties of the remnant black hole (and, in principle, the binary from which it was formed) in the superposition of exponentially-damped sinusoids which constitute the ringdown signal. 
The observation of gravitational-wave signals is now routine, and the burgeoning field of black-hole spectroscopy is already contributing to our knowledge of the gravitational-wave sky.

In this thesis we investigate the ringdown in two ways.
Firstly, we develop our ringdown models by performing fits directly to state-of-the-art numerical-relativity simulations.
Our analysis considers, for the first time, a large selection of black-hole binaries with misaligned spins.
In this clean and noise-free regime we can understand which quasinormal modes are important to include in our models, and it also informs us on the choice of ringdown start time.
These studies help to guide our expectations when we analyse real gravitational-wave data.
Secondly, we develop a novel frequency-domain ringdown analysis method for use with real data, applying it to both simulated signals and to real gravitational-wave data.
Our method solves many of the problems associated with conventional ringdown-only analyses.
Applying the method to GW150914, we quantify the significance with which a ringdown overtone can be found in the data.

\section*{Chapter contributions and synopses}

Chapter~\ref{Chapter1} is an introductory chapter, containing standard results and calculations. 
I wrote this chapter with input from my supervisor, and I created all figures. 

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent In Chapter~\ref{Chapter1} we provide wider context to the study of black-hole ringdown.
This includes gravitational waves, their production via binary black-hole mergers, and the formation of a initially perturbed remnant black hole.
We discuss the basic morphology of the ringdown signal, and provide details on its constituent quasinormal modes. 
This includes some basic calculations to build intuition.
Finally, we provide motivation for the study of the ringdown in the form of tests of general relativity. 

\begin{center}
    \rule[.5ex]{.5\textwidth}{.5pt}
\end{center}

\noindent Chapter~\ref{Chapter2} is a reformatted version of Ref.~\cite{Finch:2021iip}.
The introduction has been re-worked to fit into the thesis format, and some minor edits have been made to the text to include new references and improve readability. 
The study was conceived with help from my supervisor and co-author, Christopher J.\ Moore.
I performed all analyses, wrote the code (available at Ref.~\cite{qnmfits}), and created all figures.
I wrote the majority of the text, with input from my supervisor.

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent The study of Chapter~\ref{Chapter2} was prompted by numerical work of Giesler et al., who found that the linear ringdown description could be extended to relatively early times if multiple quasinormal-mode overtones were included in the model.
We generalised this work (which considered only aligned-spin systems) to precessing systems, testing the validity of the model across a wider parameter space.
We find a much greater variation in the performance of ringdown fits than in the aligned-spin case. 
The inclusion of mirror modes and higher harmonics, along with overtones, improves the reliability of ringdown fits with an early start time (perhaps a sign that mode mixing in the ringdown is generally more important in precessing systems); however, there remain cases with poor performing fits.
This suggests that it is not possible to reliably model the ringdown from as early a time as claimed in the work of Giesler et al.

\noindent Chapter~\ref{Chapter3} is a reformatted version of Ref.~\cite{Finch:2021qph}. 
The introduction has been re-worked to fit into the thesis format, and some minor edits have been made to the text to include new references and improve readability. 
The idea for the data-analysis method presented in this chapter was proposed by my supervisor, and jointly developed to its final form.
I performed all analyses, wrote the code (available at Ref.~\cite{fdringdown}), and created all figures. 
I wrote the majority of the text, with input from my supervisor.

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent In Chapter~\ref{Chapter3} we propose a novel frequency-domain ringdown analysis method, and demonstrate its use with simulated gravitational-wave signals.
Our approach avoids the issues of spectral leakage that would normally be expected (associated with the abrupt start of the ringdown) by modelling the inspiral and merger parts of the signal using a flexible sum of sine-Gaussian wavelets truncated at the onset of the ringdown; these effectively marginalise out the inspiral and merger.
Performing the analysis in the frequency domain allows us to use standard (and by now well-established) Bayesian inference pipelines for gravitational wave data as well as giving us the ability to readily search over the sky position and the ringdown start time, although we find that it is necessary to use an informative prior for the latter. 
We test our method by using it to analyse several simulated signals with varying signal-to-noise ratios injected into two- and three-detector networks. 
We find that our frequency-domain approach is generally able to place tighter constraints on the remnant black-hole mass and spin than a standard time-domain analysis.

\end{center}

\noindent Chapter~\ref{Chapter4} is a reformatted version of Ref.~\cite{Finch:2022ynt}. 
The introduction has been re-worked to fit into the thesis format, and some minor edits have been made to the text to improve readability. 
I conceived the study, and performed all analyses with input from my supervisor.
With the exception of Figs.~\ref{fig:other_QNMs} and \ref{fig:skymap} (created by my supervisor) I created all figures, and wrote the majority of the text.

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent Prompted by disagreements in the literature, in Chapter~\ref{Chapter4} we reanalyse the GW150914 data searching for quasinormal mode overtone using our frequency-domain approach.
Our analysis has several advantages compared to other analyses; in particular, the source sky position and the ringdown start time are marginalised over (as opposed to simply being fixed) as part of a Bayesian ringdown analysis. 
We find tentative evidence for an overtone in GW150914, but at a lower significance than reported elsewhere. 
Our preferred analysis, marginalising over the uncertainty in the time of peak strain amplitude, gives a posterior on the overtone amplitude peaked away from zero at $\sim 1.8 \sigma$.

\chapter{Conclusions and Prospects}

In this thesis we have investigated the ringdown in two ways; fits of ringdown models to noiseless NR simulations inform us about what to look for in GW observations, and analysis of GW data tests our expectations.
For the former, we extended the work of Giesler et al.~\cite{Giesler:2019uxc} to precessing BBH mergers.
It was shown that overtones alone are not sufficient to model the ringdown at early times in this extended parameter space, and even the inclusion of mirror modes and mode mixing (although improving the model in many instances) fail in some cases.
Although beyond the limits of current detector sensitivities, these studies are valuable for understanding the nature of the ringdown, and also for testing our waveform models.
For example, we also showed that a current state-of-the-art surrogate waveform, NRSur7dq4, is not sufficiently accurate in the ringdown for studies of this sort.

Regarding the nature of the ringdown, there remain many unanswered questions in ringdown modelling. 
It is still unclear if ringdown overtones are actually physical, despite convincing evidence for their effectiveness in fitting ringdown waveforms and improving constraints on remnant properties.
Their tendency to destructively interfere with each other, resulting in inflated amplitudes, and their rapid decay naturally raises suspicions of over-fitting.
Where, exactly, the nonlinearities from the merger go (if the linear ringdown model can indeed be extended to early times) is also the subject of ongoing study.

In principle, the QNM amplitudes encode information about how the remnant BH was perturbed, i.e., the initial binary configuration.
Mappings between aligned-spin binary properties and QNM amplitudes have been found~\cite{London:2014cma}, but a similar relationship for precessing systems remains elusive.
This is closely related to the issue of ringdown start time, for which choosing a reliable value becomes complicated in the precessing case.
With the code~\cite{qnmfits} developed for the work in Chapter~\ref{Chapter2}, studies of QNM amplitudes is a natural target.
Since the publication of Ref.~\cite{Finch:2021iip} the code has been developed to incorporate multimode ringdown fitting, and also has the capability to do fits of nonlinear QNM frequencies.
A second-order effect, nonlinear QNMs can be thought of as QNMs sourced by their first-order counterparts.
These quadratic QNMs have now been identified in NR waveforms~\cite{Cheung:2022rbm, Mitman:2022qdl}, hinting at their importance in waveform modelling.

But, it is now clear that QNM studies are being limited by the accuracy of state-of-the-art NR waveforms. 
Typically, NR waveforms extrapolate the signal to large distances from the source.
However, this is known to be sub-optimal for the ringdown.
One solution is to work with CCE waveforms~\cite{MaganaZertuche:2021syq}, which allows for more control over subtle choices of the waveform frame.
This machinery provides opportunities for studying in detail topics such as nonlinear QNMs and GW memory, and is readily compatible with our code.

Turning to the analysis of real data, the ringdown presents some unique challenges. 
These include low SNR signals, uncertainties with model mode content and start time, and that it is more natural to work in the time domain (due to the ringdown's abrupt start) instead of the more commonly used frequency domain.
Differences in the choices made for the analyses have already led to disagreements in the literature regarding the QNM content present in the data; in particular, the presence of an overtone in GW150914, and the presence of a higher harmonic in GW190521. 
To resolve this uncertainty I have developed a frequency-domain ringdown analysis pipeline.
This approach is introduced in Chapter~\ref{Chapter3}, and the code is available at Ref.~\cite{fdringdown}.
By employing sine-Gaussian wavelets to model the pre-ringdown signal we can move back into the frequency domain and make use of well-established analysis methods. 
The method was then employed to quantify evidence for a GW150914 overtone in Chapter~\ref{Chapter4}, contributing to an ongoing discussion in the literature with a method which marginalises over multiple uncertainties to report a single significance which was not possible before.

There is also scope for further studies, in particular for GW190521; the method can be readily applied to other GW events with any choice of QNM content.
