\label{Contributions overview} 

In \prettyref{ch:introduction} I provide the foundational material for subsequent Chapters.
A basic summary of \acp{gw} emission in the context of \gr is followed by a brief introduction to the coupling of metric perturbations to ground-based (e.g. \ligo and \virgo) and space-based (e.g. \lisa) detectors.
