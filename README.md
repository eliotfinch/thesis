# Thesis
PhD Thesis: "Modelling and Data Analysis of Black-hole Ringdown"

## Outline

### Introduction
- GR and GW (linearised field equations, ...)
- Detector response?
  
### Ringdown
- Scalar field on Schwarszchild background?
- Vibrating string analogy?
- Geodesic picture?
  
### Modelling the Ringdown from Precessing Black-hole Binaries

### Developments to my Ringdown Fitting Code
- The code has developed a lot since the first paper. I would like to include a description of the more developed fitting procedure somewhere. Things I can do (which were not presented in my first paper) include multimode fits with mixing coefficients, fits to CCE waveforms, and fits with nonlinear QNMs.
