## Outline

### Introduction
- GR and GW (linearised field equations, ...) Maybe not needed
- Instead focus on BHs and what you can learn/test with ringdown. 

### Ringdown
- Vibrating string analogy? Maybe just mention in the discussion of the scalar field calculation as an analogy. 
- Scalar field on Schwarzschild background?
- Geodesic picture? 
- Kerr spectral plot
  
### Modelling the Ringdown from Precessing Black-hole Binaries
- Flesh out NR sims, what they are and how they're set up

### Developments to my Ringdown Fitting Code
- The code has developed a lot since the first paper. I would like to include a description of the more developed fitting procedure somewhere. Things I can do (which were not presented in my first paper) include multimode fits with mixing coefficients, fits to CCE waveforms, and fits with nonlinear QNMs.

### Frequency-domain Analysis of Black Hole Ringdown
- Expand detector response, TD vs FD analysis methods

### Searching for a Ringdown Overtone in GW150914
