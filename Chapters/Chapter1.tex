\section{Ringdown}

A high-level overview of black holes, ringdown, and the usefulness of the ringdown. 
This will motivate the three main chapters of the thesis. 
Specifically, this will aim to introduce
\begin{itemize}
	\item Binary black-hole mergers
	\item Perturbed black holes and quasinormal modes (the basic idea, and a brief history of results)
	\item The no-hair theorem and tests of it
\end{itemize}


\section{Scalar field on Schwarzschild background}

An example calculation of quasinormal modes to give some idea where they come from?

\section{Quasinormal modes from the geodesic correspondence}

We focus on the $\ell = m$ case, since these modes are associated with equatorial motion. 

First, we need the metric associated with a stationary and axisymmetric spacetime. 
The stationary and axisymmetric character requires that the metric coefficients be independent of $t$ and $\phi$, so that $g_{\mu \nu} = g_{\mu \nu}(r,\theta)$.
We also require that the spacetime is invariant to the simultaneous inversion of the time $t$ and the angle $\phi$ (i.e.\ to the transformation $t \rightarrow -t$, $\phi \rightarrow -\phi$). 
The physical meaning is that the spacetime we are considering is that associated with a rotating body. 
This invariance requires 
\begin{equation}
	g_{tr} = g_{t \theta} = g_{\phi r} = g_{\phi \theta} = 0.
\end{equation}
Then we have 
\begin{align}
	\dd s^2 &= g_{tt}\dd t^2 + 2g_{t \phi} \dd t \dd \phi + g_{\phi \phi}\dd \phi^2 \nonumber \\
	&+ \qty[ g_{rr}\dd r^2 + 2g_{r \theta} \dd r \dd \theta + g_{\theta \theta} \dd \theta^2 ].
\end{align}
It can be shown \cite{Chandrasekhar:1985kt} that the term in square brackets can be brought to the diagonal form $g_{r'r'}\dd r'^2 +  g_{\theta' \theta'} \dd \theta'^2$ by a change of coordinates $r'=r'(r,\theta)$ and $\theta'=\theta'(r,\theta)$.
Renaming our variables by removing the primes, this gives
\begin{equation}
	\dd s^2 = g_{tt}\dd t^2 + g_{rr}\dd r^2 + g_{\theta \theta}\dd \theta^2 + g_{\phi \phi}\dd \phi^2 + 2g_{t \phi}\dd t\dd \phi
\end{equation}

We can find geodesic curves $x^\mu(\lambda)$ by extremising the action $S=\int\mathrm{d}\lambda\,\mathcal{L}$ where the Lagrangian is given by
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L} &= \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu} \dot{x}^\mu \dot{x}^\nu \\
	&= \frac{1}{2}\qty(g_{tt}\dot{t}^2 + g_{rr}\dot{r}^2 + g_{\theta \theta}\dot{\theta}^2 + g_{\phi \phi}\dot{\phi}^2 + 2g_{t \phi}\dot{t}\dot{\phi}), \nonumber
\end{align}
and a dot denotes a derivative with respect to the affine parameter $\lambda$ along the curve. 

We could find the second order differential geodesic equations from the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations, 
\begin{gather} \label{eq:ELeqns_1}
	\dv{\lambda}(\pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\dot{x}^\mu}) = \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{x^\mu}.
\end{gather}
However, first we recognise that the spacetime, and hence the action, are stationary; therefore the timelike component of the 4-momentum is a constant of the motion
\begin{equation}\label{eq:el_t} 
	\pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\dot{t}} = -E \;\implies\; g_{tt}\dot{t} + g_{t\phi}\dot{\phi} = -E.
\end{equation}
Similarly, from the axisymmetry of the spacetime we have another constant of motion $L$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:el_phi}
	\pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\dot{\phi}} =L \;\implies\; g_{\phi \phi}\dot{\phi} + g_{t\phi}\dot{t} = L.
\end{equation}
From Eqs.~\ref{eq:el_t} and \ref{eq:el_phi} we can solve for the two components of the 4-velocity $\dot{t}$ and $\dot{\phi}$ to give
\begin{gather} \label{eq:tdot_L}
	\dot{t} = E \frac{g_{\phi \phi} + g_{t \phi}\hat{L}}{\qty(g_{t \phi})^2 - g_{t t}g_{\phi \phi}} \\
	\label{eq:phidot_L}
	\dot{\phi} = E \frac{g_{t \phi} + g_{t t}\hat{L}}{g_{t t}g_{\phi \phi} - \qty(g_{t \phi})^2}
\end{gather}
where $\hat{L} = L/E$.
We are also free to rescale our affine parameter $\lambda\rightarrow E\lambda$ to remove $E$ from the above expressions.
The azimuthal orbital frequency can also be calculated:
\begin{gather}
	\Omega_\phi = \frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}t} =  \frac{\dot{\phi}}{\dot{t}} = -\frac{g_{t\phi}+g_{tt}\hat{L}}{g_{\phi\phi}+g_{t\phi}\hat{L}}
\end{gather}

In general, for the remaining two coordinates, $r$ and $\theta$, we can use the EL equations to find the second order differential geodesic equations.
However, in the special case of equatorial motion ($\theta=\pi/2\;\implies\;\dot{\theta}=0$) we can get a first order equation for $\dot{r}$ by considering the normalization of the four-velocity;
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rdot}
	g_{\mu\nu}\dot{x}^\mu\dot{x}^\mu = 0 \;\implies\; \dot{r}^2 = V_{\rm eff}(r;\hat{L}),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}\label{eq:Veff}
	V_{\rm eff}(r;\hat{L}) &= \frac{-g_{tt}\dot{t}^2 -g_{\phi\phi}\dot{\phi}^2-2g_{t\phi}\dot{t}\dot{\phi} }{g_{rr}} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{g_{tt} \hat{L}^2+2 g_{t\phi } \hat{L}+g_{\phi\phi}}{g_{rr}(g_{t\phi}^2-g_{tt} g_{\phi \phi})},
\end{align}
and in the final line we have used Eqs.~\ref{eq:tdot_L} and \ref{eq:phidot_L} to eliminate $\dot{t}$ and $\dot{\phi}$.
In Eq.~\ref{eq:Veff} it is to be understood that the $g_{\mu\nu}$ metric coefficients are to be evaluated on the equatorial plane $\theta=\pi/2$ and so are only functions of $r$.

A \emph{light ring} is circular null geodesic orbit. 
The radius, $r_*$, and angular momentum, $\hat{L}_*$, of such an orbit must satisfy $V_{\rm eff} = V'_{\rm eff} = 0$, where a prime denotes a radial derivative with respect to $r$. The first condition yields
\begin{equation}
	\hat{L}_*(r) = \frac{-g_{t \phi} \pm \sqrt{g_{t \phi}^2 - g_{t t}g_{\phi \phi}}}{g_{t t}},
\end{equation}
while the second gives implicit formula for $r_*$:
\begin{gather}
	V'_{\rm eff}\big(r_*;\hat{L}_*(r_*)\big) = 0.
\end{gather}
In the case of the Kerr metric single root $r_*$.

Having found the equations of the light ring, now consider neighboring geodesics. 
First, consider polar motion. The Euler-Lagrange for $\theta$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:ELeqns_1} with $x^\mu=\theta$) is 
\begin{align}\label{eq:el_theta}
	g_{\theta \theta} \ddot{\theta} + & \qty(\pdv{g_{\theta \theta}}{\theta} \dot{\theta} + \pdv{g_{\theta \theta}}{r} \dot{r}) \dot{\theta}
	= \frac{1}{2} \bigg(\pdv{g_{t t}}{\theta} \dot{t}^2 + \nonumber \\ &\pdv{g_{r r}}{\theta} \dot{r}^2 + \pdv{g_{\theta \theta}}{\theta} \dot{\theta}^2 + \pdv{g_{\phi \phi}}{\theta} \dot{\phi}^2 + 2\pdv{g_{t \phi}}{\theta} \dot{t}\dot{\phi}\bigg).
\end{align}
Consider small perturbations in the $\theta$ direction \footnote{It is sufficient to consider $\theta$ and $r$ perturbations separately\ldots} about the light ring; i.e. set $r = r_*$, $\theta = \pi/2+\delta\theta(\lambda)$, and where $\dot{t}$ and $\dot{\phi}$ are given by Eqs.~\ref{eq:tdot_L} and \ref{eq:phidot_L} respectively and discard terms $\mathcal{O}(\delta\theta^2)$. 
This gives
\begin{align}\label{eq:el_theta_expanded}
	g_{\theta \theta}&(r_*,\pi/2) \ddot{\delta \theta} = \frac{1}{2} \bigg(\pdv[2]{g_{t t}(r_*,\pi/2)}{\theta} \dot{t}^2  
	+ \nonumber\\ & \pdv[2]{g_{\phi\phi}(r_*,\pi/2)}{\theta} \dot{\phi}^2 
	+2\pdv[2]{g_{t \phi}(r_*,\pi/2)}{\theta} \dot{t}\dot{\phi}\bigg)\delta \theta.
\end{align}
which describes simple harmonic motion, $\ddot{\delta\theta}=-\tilde{\Omega}^2_\theta\delta\theta$, where the constant $\tilde{\Omega}_\theta$ is the frequency of the oscillations with respect to the parameter $\lambda$.
The frequency of the oscillations with respect to coordinate time $t$ is given by
\begin{align}
	\Omega_\theta = \frac{\tilde{\Omega}_\theta}{\dot{t}} =\sqrt{-\frac{
			\pdv[2]{g_{t t}}{\theta} +2\pdv[2]{g_{t \phi}}{\theta} \Omega_\phi + \pdv[2]{g_{\phi\phi}}{\theta} \Omega_\phi^2
		}{2g_{\theta \theta}}} ,
\end{align}
where all quantities on the right hand side are to be evaluated at the light ring. 
In the case of the Kerr metric $\Omega_\theta^2>0$ and the light ring is stable in the polar direction.

Now consider motion in the radial direction ($\dot{r}\neq 0$).
Differentiating Eq.~\ref{eq:rdot} with respect to $\lambda$ gives
\begin{align}
	\ddot{r} = \frac{1}{2}V'_{\rm eff}(r).
\end{align}
Consider small perturbations $r = r_*+\delta r(\lambda)$ with $\theta = \pi/2$ and discarding $\mathcal{O}(\delta r^2)$ terms gives
\begin{align}
	\ddot{\delta r} = \frac{1}{2}V''_{\rm eff}(r_*)\delta r.
\end{align}
Looking for periodic solutions, the frequency of the radial oscillaitons (with respect to coordinate time) is given by
\begin{align}
	\Omega_{r} = \sqrt{-\frac{V''_{\rm eff}(r_*)}{2\dot{t}^2}}.
\end{align}
In the case of the Kerr metric the light ring orbit has $\Omega_r^2<0$ and is unstable in the radial direction; therefore $\Gamma = (-\Omega_r^2)^{-1/2}$ is the instability (Lyapunov) timescale.

\section{The Kerr Spectrum}

An explanation of the conventions used, and maybe also the general waveform (although it make make sense to have that right at the top).
